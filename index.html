    <!-- In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.
    
    Imagine you recieve a box from your favorite online retailer -- the content is the item in the box, or in our case a header, 
a paragraph, or imagine content.-->

<!-- The content is surrounded by a space called padding similiar to how bubble wrap seperates an item from the box around it.
Think of the border like the cardboard box your item was shipped in. -->

<!-- Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elemets.

Here the bottom element has a larger top margin.pushing it further doen the page. ie. <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-3.png">-->

<body>
    <!-- add a div element in the body. Set the class attribute equal to canvas. This will act as the canvas for your painting. -->
    <div class="canvas"></div>
    <!-- Before you can start styling the div you added, you need to link your CSS to your HTML 
      See line 7.-->
